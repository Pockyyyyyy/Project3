            <h1>What will Game Designers be Facing while Desiging Games?</h1>
            <h3>Workshop+Talk w/ Three Famous Game Designers</h3>
            <h3>Dec 20th, 10.30 AM EST (Zoom)</h3>

            <h5>These events are free and open to the public.
                No prior game design experience required.</h5>

            <h5>Game Designers craft the core mechanics of a game.
                This means that they are responsible for deciding how games work when the player starts playing
                them.
                Most
                importantly, game designers create rules.
                These rules govern how games work.
                In this workshop, participants will be introduced to what problems and rules the game designers will
                be
                facing
                when
                desiging games through speaks' life experience.

                    <p> Game designers love solving problems, perfecting games until they
                        sing. But sometimes you hit a design problem so thorny that you
                        just can't find a solution, and maybe never will. This may be a
                        "cursed problem": a problem with some inherent contradiction of
                        goals. Consider the kingmaker problem. A designer wants to
                        emphasize certain player skills, but also wants free-for-all PvP,
                        which incentivizes politics in favor of those skills. Cursed problems
                        like these haunt designers across game and genre. And somehow
                        all designers have to deal with them.In this talk, Alex Jaffe (Riot
                        Games) will present a theory of cursed problems. He'll show case
                        studies of decades-old problems, and he'll explore the four design
                        paradigms that have helped developers face these problems and
                        survive.

                    <p>Game designers frequently emphasize the "game" part of their title.
                        In this inspirational talk, Stone will focus on the "designer" aspect.
                        How is game design similar to other forms of design, such as
                        fashion design, automotive design or industrial design? What can
                        we learn from these other disciplines that will help us grow as game
                        designers, both personally and professionally? Stone describes his
                        own personal design journey and the lessons he has learned along
                        the way. Topics will include design history, the lives of famous
                        designers, techniques taught in design schools, and the
                        philosophies of world-class design studios.

                    <p> "Tell me about some brilliant mechanics in games that are hidden
                        from the player to get across a certain feeling." This is the question
                        Jennifer Scheurle posed on Twitter that opened up a can of worms
                        among the games community, as thousands of likes and replies
                        flooded into her feed. It was a question waiting to be asked with
                        many well-established developers sharing their secret techniques. In
                        this talk, Jennifer will give context to these techniques that game
                        developers have used for decades, and celebrate them with a
                        detailed collection and how-to of those techniques from the best
                        games and designers all over the world.
