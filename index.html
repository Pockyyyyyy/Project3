What will Game Designers be Facing while Desiging Games?
Workshop+Talk w/ Three Famous Game Designers

These events are free and open to the public.
No prior game design experience required.

Game Designers craft the core mechanics of a game. 
This means that they are responsible for deciding how games work when the player starts playing them. Most importantly, game designers create rules. 
These rules govern how games work. 
In this workshop, participants will be introduced to what problems and rules the game designers will be facing when desiging games through speaks' life experience.

Cursed Problems in Game Designer

Game designers love solving problems, perfecting games until they
sing. But sometimes you hit a design problem so thorny that you
just can't find a solution, and maybe never will. This may be a
"cursed problem": a problem with some inherent contradiction of
goals. Consider the kingmaker problem. A designer wants to
emphasize certain player skills, but also wants free-for-all PvP,
which incentivizes politics in favor of those skills. Cursed problems
like these haunt designers across game and genre. And somehow
all designers have to deal with them.In this talk, Alex Jaffe (Riot
Games) will present a theory of cursed problems. He'll show case
studies of decades-old problems, and he'll explore the four design
paradigms that have helped developers face these problems and
survive.

<p>Stone Librande
An Video Game Designer at Riot Games.

Game ï¼œ Design

Game designers frequently emphasize the "game" part of their title.
In this inspirational talk, Stone will focus on the "designer" aspect.
How is game design similar to other forms of design, such as
fashion design, automotive design or industrial design? What can
we learn from these other disciplines that will help us grow as game
designers, both personally and professionally? Stone describes his
own personal design journey and the lessons he has learned along
the way. Topics will include design history, the lives of famous
designers, techniques taught in design schools, and the
philosophies of world-class design studios.
